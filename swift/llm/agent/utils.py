    This algorithm comes from paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00986.pdf

    Agent response format:

    ```text
        Thought: you should always think about what to do
        Action: the action to take, should be one of the above tools[fire_recognition,
            fire_alert, call_police, call_fireman]
        Action Input: the input to the action
        Observation: the result of the action
        ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can be repeated zero or more times)
        Thought: I now know the final answer
        Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
    ```

    Args:
        response: The response text
        use_loss_scale: Use weighted loss. With this, some part of the loss will be enhanced to improve performance.

    Returns:
        A tuple of agent response parts and their weights.
