## Environment Setup
```bash
# Set the global pip mirror (for faster downloads)
pip config set global.index-url https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
# Install ms-swift
pip install 'ms-swift[llm]' -U

# Environment alignment (usually not necessary to run. If you encounter errors, you can run the following code to test with the latest environment in the repository)
pip install -r requirements/framework.txt  -U
pip install -r requirements/llm.txt  -U
```

## Inference Before Fine-Tuning

Using python:
```python
import os
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'

from swift.llm import ModelType, InferArguments, infer_main
infer_args = InferArguments(model_type=ModelType.qwen1half_4b_chat)
infer_main(infer_args)

<<< Who are you?
I am a large-scale language model from Alibaba Cloud, and my name is Qwen.
--------------------------------------------------
<<< What's your name?
I am Qwen, a large language model from Alibaba Cloud.
--------------------------------------------------
<<< Who developed you?
I am independently developed by Alibaba Cloud as a large-scale language model.
--------------------------------------------------
<<< Where is the capital of Zhejiang?
The capital of Zhejiang is Hangzhou.
--------------------------------------------------
<<< What's good to eat here?
Zhejiang cuisine is very rich, including famous dishes such as Hangzhou's West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy, Dongpo Pork, Longjing Shrimp, and Sister Song's Fish Soup. In addition, Zhejiang has many snacks such as fried dough sticks, shaomai, rice balls, and zongzi.
--------------------------------------------------
<<< What to do when you can't sleep at night?
If you can't sleep at night, you can try the following methods:

1. Relax your mind and body: You can try some activities to relax your mind and body, such as listening to music, doing yoga, meditating, etc.

2. Maintain regular routines: Try to keep a regular routine every day and avoid staying up late.

3. Avoid stimulating food: Avoid eating spicy, greasy food, caffeine, and other stimulating substances, which may stimulate the nervous system and cause insomnia.

4. Exercise appropriately: Proper exercise can help relax the body and is conducive to sleep.

5. Drink milk before bed: Milk contains tryptophan, which can help the body produce melatonin and aid sleep.

```
If you want to perform single-sample inference, you can refer to [LLM Inference Documentation](LLM-inference.md#qwen-7b-chat)

Using CLI:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 swift infer --model_type qwen1half-4b-chat
```

## Fine-Tuning
Note: Since self-cognition training involves knowledge editing, it's suggested to add lora_target_modules to **MLP**. You can specify `--lora_target_modules ALL` to add LoRA to all the linear layers (including qkvo and mlp), which **usually yields the best results**.

Using python:
```python
# Experimental environment: A10, 3090, V100, ...

os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'

from swift.llm import DatasetName, ModelType, SftArguments, sft_main

If you want to perform single-sample inference, you can refer to [LLM Inference Documentation](LLM-inference#qwen-7b-chat)

Using CLI:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 swift infer --model_type qwen1half-4b-chat
```

## Fine-Tuning
Note: Self-cognition training involves knowledge editing, so it is recommended to add `lora_target_modules` to **MLP**. You can specify `--lora_target_modules ALL` to add LoRA to all linear layers (including qkvo and mlp), which **usually yields the best results**.

Using Python:
```python
# Experimental environment: A10, 3090, V100, ...

Using CLI (DDP):
> If you have GPUs like the 3090, you can reduce `max_length` to decrease memory usage.

    --self_cognition_sample 500 \

```

## Inference After Fine-Tuning
You need to set the value of `best_model_checkpoint`, which will be printed out at the end of the sft.

Using Python:
```python
import os
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'

from swift.llm import InferArguments, merge_lora, infer_main

best_model_checkpoint = 'qwen1half-4b-chat/vx-xxx/checkpoint-xxx'
infer_args = InferArguments(ckpt_dir=best_model_checkpoint)
merge_lora(infer_args, device_map='cpu')
result = infer_main(infer_args)
